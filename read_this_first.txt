Solution to my level-1 challenge of google foobar challenge, i-love-jane-janice

DO NOT COPY THIS.

The task was to decrypt the encrypted code.
-- All the lowercase alphabets in [a,b,.....,z] have to be replaced by lowercase [z,y,.....a].
-- All the other characters have to left untouched

>>>Test case:
>>>I have used a test case in the sol6.py, which is the one same in google-foobar challenge.
>>>Try with "vmxibkgrlm", it should return the string "encryption"

PS: Sol6 cuz first 5 sols had some minor bugs
